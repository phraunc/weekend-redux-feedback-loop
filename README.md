# Project Name
weekend-redux-feedback-loop

## Description
During this project, I created 5 pages that had different survey questions on them with a area to put a 1 to 5 on it.  The last survey question was actially a comment area to put any amount of comment you wanted.  At the bottom of every page, there was a next button that went to the next page.  I could not figure out how to input an alert or error message that would not let you click next until the input fied for that particular survey question was answered.  The Last page was a review page with all the answers you put on it that allowed you to basically check your answers and verify everything was good.  After you have verified that you liked what you had, you would then click on the submit button and then would go to a final page of "Thank you for your feedback" and then ask to redo the survey in which you would click that button and bring you back to the start.

I had problems with not so much making the pages or links, but I forgot how to retrieve a saved state from the index.js and save my information to that until I needed it again.  I made different TYPEs for the reducer to get called upon and the intent was to have the reducer go to the next page. I could not get the POST route working to save the information to the DB and get the last page to clear inputs on the survey to start again.
